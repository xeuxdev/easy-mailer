To get analytics on your emails requests i.e. `Accepted` , `Rejected`, `Pending` emails

1. **Sign Up for an easymailer account**

- Go to [Easymailer](https://easymailer.vercel.app/auth)

- Sign up with your google account.

- You should be redirected to your dashboard.

2. **Create Your API KEY**

- Click on your avatar and click on settings.

- On your settings page, click on the `API` tab.

- Click the `Generate new API key` button to generate your api key.

- Copy and Paste in a secure location as you won't be able to see it again.

3. **Set up the `API` key**

- in your `.env` file paste your `API` key

```js filename=".env" copy
MAILER_API_KEY = "your api key"
```

- you should be able to see your analytics on each batch of emails sent.
